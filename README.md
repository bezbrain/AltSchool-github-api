# Getting Started with my GitHub Profile Project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Dependencies

Other than the default dependencies installed in the course of installing CRA using `npx install create-react-app githubprofile` below are other dependencies/librabries installed:

- `axios`: This is a library used to fetch all needed data from the github endpoints.
- `react-router-dom`: This is used to maintain different pages and most importantly, handle dynamic routes
- `react-helmet`: This is used to handle the meta tag and title tag for every page
